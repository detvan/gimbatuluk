When  I  wake  up,  the  other  side  of  the  bed  is  cold.  My  
fingers  stretch  out,  seeking  Prim’s  warmth  but  finding  only  
the  rough  canvas  cover  of  the  mattress.  She  must  have  had  
bad dreams and climbed in with our mother. Of course, she 
did. This is the day of the reaping.
I  prop  myself  up  on  one  elbow.  There’s  enough  light  in  
the  bedroom  to  see  them.  My  little  sister,  Prim,  curled  up
